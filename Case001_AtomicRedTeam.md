# Atomic Red Team Attack Script

Project Brief: This project is to set up a win 10 virtual machine as a target, attack it using the atomic red team attack script. Simulate that we are a Forensic Analyst just arriving to the site and proceed with a full Windows Forensics case as we would on field. Finishing with a deacted forensic report at the end.

Below are the attacks that this script has executed:

Tools used:
- EZTools
- Volitility
- KAPE
- Autopsy
- RegRipper
- Arsenal Image Mounter

## Collection


**Order of collection should always follow the order of volitility**
- **Step 1**: In real life we will either take a live Data from the machine or put the machine into hibernation so we can collect the data from the memory through hiber.sys file on windows. All this should be done
with a write blocker. In the VM now, we will suspend the VM first. Since I am using VMware, I will preserve the .vmem and the .vmsn and hash it. Next we will collect the disk by using qemu-img by running 
`qemu-img.exe convert -O vpc <full path that contains vmdk> output_image.vhd`. Hashes will be generated after all this. In real life, all this should be done with FTK Imager instead.

Examiner notes: So after running the script, never has been touched, I suspended the machine immediately to prevent it's state. After that, I took a snapshot. I then preserved the .vmem and .vmsn file to a new location as well as using qemu-img to preserve the disk by exporting as vhd. After that, the first thing and most important thing to do is to generate and compare hash values.

List of artifacts to collect and examine

Disk Analysis Process: 
- System & Usesr Info
   - Registry
- File Analysis
   - NTFS
- Evidence of Execution
   - Background Activity Moderator
   - ShimCache
   - Amcache
   - Prefetch
- Persistence Mechanisms
   - Run Keys
   - Startup Folder
   - Scheduled Tasks
   - Services
- Event Log Analysis

Examiner notes: Before any deep investigating, I mounted the disk using Arsenal image mounter, it was put on read mode only. However, it would be a better practice to have a hardware write blocker in real life, to prevent any accidental tempering of the disk.

![04](images/pwf_04.png)

Examiner notes: After browsing around and familiarise with the disk (users and files on the disk etc). I used KAPE (KAPE TRIAGE selection) to extract the most common and important evidence. Registries, Event logs, startup Folders etc.

## NTFS - File System Analysis

Examiner note: We will parse the file with the following command `MFTECmd.exe -f <the mft we want to parse> --csv <Full path that we wanna store the CSV> --csvf <name of csv eg: MFT.csv>`. looking at the parsed csv in timeline explorer, we see the following files related to the AtomicRedTeam.

**Which files are related to AtomicRedTeam?**
- Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1
- Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psm1
- AtomicClassSchema.ps1
- Get-AtomicTechnique.ps1
- ART-attack.ps1

**What is the MFT Entry Number for the file "ART-attack.ps1"?**

![19](pwf_19.png)

To see more details in the MFT, I used `MFTECmd.exe -f <MFT> --de <Entry Number>` and we will see the metadata of that file entry

**Was "ART-attack.ps1" timestomped?**

Examiner note: Since all the time in MAC(b) is very similar, it is unlikely that the MFT had been modified. (Even if the time isn't exactly the same, if they are close to each other, it might still be genuine. Since a file inherits the FN time from the zip file.)

**When was the file "deleteme_T1551.004" created and deleted?**


![image](images/pwf_20.png)

Examiner note: So we see the entry of deleteme, we can see if we can find more info from the mft.

We can check the $J for file creation, close and deletion. As shown in image, it was deleted in 2025-05-28 19:48:37

**What was the Entry number for "deleteme_T1551.004" and does it still exist in the MFT?**

102492 and since it is FLAGed `IsFree`, it has been deleted. But not overwrited by new files, so might still exist in memory.

Examiner note: As the above image shows, notepad.exe is very likely to be used in the attack along side with the usual suspected exe (cmd, explorer, and other exe with weird characters)

**Determine the cache entry position for:** 
![image](images/pwf_25.png)
![image](images/pwf_26.png)
- AtomicService.exe: 24
- mavinject.exe: 23

**What SHA-1 hash did Amcache record for AtomicService.exe?**
Examiner note: Very interesting thing for trouble shooting, if we check the Amcache we got. There would be no Atomic services. After a bit of digging, I found that the Amcache is updated by the Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser Schedule Task Detail Blog post: https://dfir.ru/2018/12/02/the-cit-database-and-the-syscache-hive/

 So to get what we want, we have to revert the VM to freshly compromised and execute this schtask. Then we will see the atomic service and it's hash:
 `c51217ce3d1959e99886a567d21d0b97022bd6e3`

**What is the full path of the AtomicService.exe that was added to the run keys?**

![image](images/pwf_33.png)
![image](images/pwf_34.png)
Examiner note: Nothing much in the runOnce key, but in the Run key, we found the AtomicRedTeam.exe which once existed under `C:\Path\AtomicRedTeam.exe`

Path file was deleted. 

**What is the name of the suspicious script in the StartUp folder?**
Examiner note: In the KAPE TRIAGE package, we also found nothing. However, we can have a look in the MFT.csv
![36](images/pwf_36.png)
Examiner note: Interestingly we found a .bot startup script, lets check it in the original disk in ftk imager. Found a flag.
![37](images/pwf_37.png)

**When was the suspicious atomic service installed?**
Examiner note: For services, I looked into the Tasks key and services key in the SYSTEM registry

![39](images/pwf_39.png)
![40](images/pwf_40.png)
![41](images/pwf_41.png)
![42](images/pwf_42.png)

Examiner note: Under `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\` we found the 2 scheduled tasks created by the attack script.

**Which tasks were created by the IEUser and what's the creation time?**
Searching the parsed txt file by regripper, we also find the following tasks under the `taskcache` plugin. 
```
Path: \T1053_005_OnLogon
URI : \T1053_005_OnLogon
Task Reg Time : 2025-05-28 19:47:32Z
Task Last Run : 2025-06-02 08:27:49Z
Task Completed: 2025-06-02 08:27:58Z
```

```
Path: \T1053_005_OnStartup
URI : \T1053_005_OnStartup
Task Reg Time : 2025-05-28 19:47:32Z
Task Last Run : 2025-06-02 08:27:48Z
Task Completed: 2025-06-02 08:27:57Z
```
**How many times did they execute?**

![40](images/pwf_40.png)
![41](images/pwf_41.png)

Examiner note: Looking at the Tasks key, the OnStartup task were last ran on 2025-06-02 08:27:48 and stopped on 2025-06-02 08:27:57, and the OnLogon task were ran on 2025-06-02 08:27:49 and stopped on 2025-06-02 08:27:58. An extra tip is that we can use the Autoruns tool in the sysinternals suite. we can easily identify anomaly tasks.

## Windows Event Log Analysis
Examiner note: For Event Log Analysis, I will use the event log explorer tool.

**Was Defender on?**
No, it was turned off and the event ID 5001 defender disabled was generated.
![51](images/pwf_51.png)

**What logins do we have during the time frame?**

![53](images/pwf_53.png)

Examiner notes: looking at the 4624 event ids, we have different types of logons such as type 2 (interactive), 5 (service) etc. We are interested in the user IEUser. So by filtering event log explorer, we can see who logged in during the incident time frame. So identifying the user(s) involve, we can filter by their Logon ID and see all events associated with that user.

**What commands did powershell executed?**
Examiner note: In event log explorer, we can filter powershell.evtx with event log 400 to see all powershell activities, and get a clear timeline of what has happened.

![43](images/pwf_46.png)
![43](images/pwf_47.png)
![43](images/pwf_49.png)

Below is base64 decoded string of event 400 from PS
Set-Content -path "$env:SystemRoot/Temp/art-marker.txt" -value "Hello from the Atomic Red Team"

![43](images/pwf_50.png)

At some point we even see an invoke-webrequest to the atomic-red-team github page.

**Processes in memory**

**PID of suspicious processes?**
powershell.exe		7388
notepad.exe		5860
AtomicService.exe	8456

Command ran: vol.py -f Windows\ 10\ x64-Snapshot1.vmem windows.psscan

Examiner note: Below shows the suspicious processes: AtomicService (pid:8456), whoami.exe (pid:7272), notepad.exe (pid:5860), powershell (pid:7388)

![54](images/pwf_54.png)

Examiner note: After Identifying the suspicious process, I wrote a bash script which automates the commands to use pstree, pslist, dlllist, and getsid. Basically this will help us understand the child parent relationship, the related image and it's paths, related dlls and related users for each processes.

(Nothing particularly interesting)

Examiner note: I then dumped the atomic service useing `vol.py -f Windows\ 10\ x64-Snapshot1.vmem windows.psscan --pid 8456 --dump`, it's sha256 
hash is `4c4b71bf18456cc551c646a62b88494a77f369d3a60b9cdc65fab22571e51b75  8456.AtomicService..0xae0000.dmp`. 

Using `strings 8456.AtomicService..0xae0000.dmp`, we find more IOCs, which can be used to write YARA rules:
![64](images/pwf_64.png)

Examiner note: Looking at the dlllist of notepad.exe, we can see a process injection where the process notepad.exe got injected with a malicious 
dll, we can dump the dlls using `vol.py -f Windows\ 10\ x64-Snapshot1.vmem windows.dlllist --pid 5860 --dump`, the hash of malicious dll is 
`e6e2cc4cbb09a5e778b182fcc41f7cc294cf3c456b7a0395f236ca07d033373b  pid.5860.T1055.001.dll.0x1095f2bbb10.0x7ffc92090000.dmp`, and do a malware 
analysis. 

After running `strings pid.5860.T1055.001.dll.0x1095f2bbb10.0x7ffc92090000.dmp`, there are also interesting findings:
![65](images/pwf_65.png)

From Mitre Att&ck [T1179](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004/) is an input capture, technique, thus we can infer this dll has keylogging capabilities.

## Super Timeline

1. use vol to generate bodyfile
2. parse disk with log2timeline to gen a plaso file
3. merge bodyfile and plaso file to 1 file
4. and generate a super timeline with psort from plaso tools
5. Analysis with Timeline explorer

1. We will convert vhd to raw: `qemu-img convert -O raw win10-disk.vhd win10-disk.raw`
2. We then make a bodyfile of the memory: vol.py -f <memoryfile> timeliner --create-bodyfile
3. Make disk plaso file with the raw: log2timeline.py --storage-file disk.plaso <path to disk file in raw format> //Disk.plaso is the output file (get plaso file to merge with volatility.body)
4. `pinfo.py disk.plaso` //to see overview info of the plaso file
5. To merge plaso with the body file, we say `log2timeline.py --parser=mactime --storage-file=disk.plaso volatility.body`, then we want to create a csv file we can read. To convert the plaso file to csv, we say `psort.py -o l2tcsv -w super-timeline.csv disk.plaso` this will output a very big file which isnt ideal, so we can add a filter by saying `psort.py -o l2tcsv -w super-timeline.csv disk.plaso "date > '2022-03-01 00:00:00'"` The filter "date > '2022-03-01 00:00:00'" is sayingI want anything after the date '2022-03-01 00:00:00'.


My work
-
1. I converted the vhd to raw: `qemu-img convert -O raw C:\Users\RGB_Gamr\Desktop\PWF_Victim\OG\PWF_Victim.vhd C:\Users\RGB_Gamr\Desktop\PWF_Victim\OG\PWF_Victim.raw`

![66](images/pwf_66.png)

2. I then created the body file with `vol.py -f 'Windows 10 x64-Snapshot1.vmem' timeliner --create-bodyfile`

![67](images/pwf_67.png)
![68](images/pwf_68.png)

We will then run `log2timeline --storage-file disk.plaso PWF_Victim.raw`










## Analysing Super Timeline

First, we will filter by the time when I ran the script. In reality, this will be the beginning of the incident. Then we can do searches according to what we know,
in this case, we know everything started with a script called `ART-attack.ps1`. So we can search it.  Next we can look for anything related to `atomicservice.exe`,
and `notepad.exe`






**To use super timeline effectively, we would like to search by the suspicious programs, and construct a precise super timeline for each of these processes or exe**
